# Actix : Build a REST API with Rust and MongoDB

This project is a demo veersion of Actix framework. In this exemple we will learn how to structure a Rust application, build a REST API and persist our data using MongoDB. 

## Install dependencies:
To install dependencies use, you can add it to the file named file `Cargo.toml` and run the `cargo build` command to install all dependencies.


### Notes:
1. The `Cargo.lock` file contains the dependencies (like `package-lock.json` in NodeJs).
2. The `cargo build` command download & compile dependencies from the [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
3. You should be run this command after any change in your rust file (any file with extension `*.rs`) in order to generate the build files.
4. This command install dependencies and save it in the cache in order to compile fast the project in the next time.
5. To read more about the cargo dependencies, please check [this website](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/cargo/deps.html).

## Create your API: 
To create the first API in `Actix` using `Rust`, please create the Actix server and add your service in the `main.rs` file.

## Check the Rust code :
To check the Rust sytaxe is correct, please type the following command `cargo check`.

## Run the project:
To run the build, type the following command cargo run.
